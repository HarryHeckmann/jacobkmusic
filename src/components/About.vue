                 I am a trumpeter and private instructor based out of San Antonio, TX. A graduate of the University of North Texas School of Music, I hold both a Bachelors in Music Education and a Masters in Trumpet Performance. During my time at UNT, I studied trumpet with Dr. Jason Bergman and baroque trumpet with Professor Adam Gordon, as well as with doctoral students Trevor Duell, Kevin Whalen, and Marty Bishop during my undergraduate degree. During my Masters at UNT, I performed as a member of the UNT Symphonic Band under Professor Dennis Fisher, the UNT Concert Orchestra under Dr. Clay Couturiaux, and the inaugural semester of the UNT Wind Ensemble under Dr. Nicholas Williams.

                 I am a member of the Phi Tau Chapter of Mu Phi Epsilon, where I served as the Steward/Parliamentarian in 2014 and 2016 and the SERV Committee Chair in 2014. My professional associations include memberships in the Texas Music Educators' Association (TMEA) and the International Trumpet Guild (ITG).
